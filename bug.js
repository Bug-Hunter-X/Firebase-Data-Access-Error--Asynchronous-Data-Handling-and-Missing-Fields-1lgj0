The Firebase SDK might throw an error if you try to access a property of a document snapshot before the snapshot has fully loaded.  This is often seen when accessing data within the `onSnapshot` listener before the initial data has been received. For example:

```javascript
import { onSnapshot, collection } from 'firebase/firestore';

db.onSnapshot(collection(db, 'users'), (snapshot) => {
  snapshot.docs.forEach((doc) => {
    console.log(doc.data().name); // Error if data hasn't loaded yet
  });
});
```
This code can throw an error because `doc.data().name` might be accessed before the data has been populated.  Another scenario is attempting to read a field that doesn't exist in the document, causing a `TypeError` or similar.
